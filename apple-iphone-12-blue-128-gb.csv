7,So far so good. It‚Äôs my dream to own an iPhone for over a decade. Finally came true with iPhone 12. Previously owned Samsung S9 plus so competing with android i will say my likes and dislikes.Likes:1. OS is really fluid2. Security features like facial recognition for app installation etc3. Little nuances like ringtone sound reduction automatically after I see the mobile4. Camera is good though still equal to Samsung can‚Äôt say extraordinary 5. Facial unlock is really quick6. 5G ready s...READ MORE
8,"Upgraded from iPhone X.Noticed 3 major differences instantly.1. Lot of difference in camera pictures. The best camera model from iPhone so far2. Light weight and feels very handy during one hand use3. Screen brightness is better than iPhone XNot mentioning about other aspects like performance , speed as they already are close to perfect. Battery - not more than one complete day after constant usage of WhatsApp, safari, emails, spotify music & youtube videosREAD MORE"
9,"After being a long time samsung user i switched to iphone again after iphone 4s and i am thoroughly enjoying it. Ios 14 is much polished and android users will surely enjoy using ios now. Battry lasts a day with moderate use. Performance, usability, camera, sound and display everything is top notch. Icing on the cake apple car play is much more usable than android autoüò¨üò¨READ MORE"

12,"Bought First Apple product, Awesome design and look.Happy with the performance but little disappointed with no charger and headphone at this price that's why 4 star given.Anyways enjoying the one of the finest iPhone available in Market..Thanks to flipkart for fast delivery.READ MORE"
13,I want to tell u something before I say anything about this iphone I'm not downgrading this iphone I just wasn't surprised enough after using the phone honestly it made me older.... Camera is the best no need to worry about that...the bionic A14 chip is fast no lags or anything screen is good too...ummm everything is fine but if u want to try something new don't go for iphone...that's my opinion...READ MORE
14,"The best is yet to come, I am really happy with the product was delivered on time by Flipkart, over all liked the colours it‚Äôs a dream come to true to finally have an iPhone. Thank you FlipkartREAD MORE"
15,"Finally moved from Android (OnePlus 7T) to iOS & it‚Äôs a different level. Display is outstanding. Camera superb as usual. But surprised with the battery performance, its really great. Only drawback is the missing of 90Hz display, missed the fluidity of that. May be with time will habituated with that. But it‚Äôs worth noting. Overall an awesome luxurious experience from a luxurious brand.READ MORE"
16,"First time in my life I'm trying iphone, I'm an android Samsung note user. There are no powerful android phones which are compact to use single handedly..that's the main reason I'm living the iPhone. I didn't go for the 12 Pro max as it is ginormous in size and the 12 mini was reviewed to have sub par battery life. 12 and 12 Pro are the ideal phones for the best of both worlds. I didnt need the telephoto and Lidar camera, so I went with 12 to save some thousands. I'm enjoying the single hande...READ MORE"
17,"Overall a good experience. Takes sometime to get used to iOS if you're coming from android. The display is good, looks natural. I turned off true tone as I felt it made the display warmer than I like. Also you might find the colours not very saturated if you're coming from a Samsung phone.Battery is very good, lasts an entire day and more for me. Camera is also pretty good.READ MORE"
18,This is my first Apple product and obviously I was very excited before unboxing it. The phone feels very premium and truly goes with the brand. Each and every specification of the phone is worth the money. So just go ahead and purchase it without any second thought. I pre-ordered it and received the product on time. Thanks Flipkart for prompt service.READ MORE
19,"Was using the OnePlus 7 pro before this, it was a 2 year old device but still had better battery backup than this Iphone. Rest you all know its an iphone, great camera, nice screen, ios is very smooth and consistent which many android phones lack, Face ID is a pain during Covid and boy they don't give charger which sucks.Overall a nice phone, battery should have been betterREAD MORE"
20,"Using iPhone since 5S onwards, it's never been a single thought to switch any other mobiles other than Apple. And iPhone 12 is an another wonderful device from Apple, finally upgraded from iPhone 7 --> iPhone 12 256GB. So happy with the product and comfort.Still my old iPhone 7 is working like new, that is what I love about apple products. Highly recommend.Thanks for quick delivery.READ MORE"
21,It's maintaining apple's quality as usual. Good phone and compatibility use. The phone is little bit small when compared to other competitive products. There is no outstanding features in this phone when compare to Samsung or one plus. But I'm sure Apple uses must love this phone. The seller is also very good and they keep promising to deliver things on time for meeting Beyond expectations.READ MORE
22,"Moved to iPhone from Android since cupcake days and I‚Äôm loving it so far. Brilliant display, camera and performance. IOS is still a little behind Android in terms of features and shortcuts in my opinion but it‚Äôs very close. Still getting used to all the features of iOS. Per-ordered on the launch day and it arrived barely on time. Overall happy with the purchase.READ MORE"

25,"Switched from Android to iOS and won‚Äôt regret a bit. This one of the best devices have used in a while. Pros: 1. Performance is super snappy, no lags whatsoever. 2. Battery performance is pretty good too. M not a heavy user so currently charging it once every two days. 3. Haven‚Äôt used camera much but pretty sure it‚Äôs splendid too. 4.

26,"price range is not for everyone but if you can afford it don't hesitate a bit because this phones gives you most realistic camera, stunning filters, efficient battery life, multimedia files take low storage, applications run smoothly and last but best part is the security features for messaging and payments. I am not asking everyone to buy it but if you can afford an apple phone then you should always go for it without giving a second thoughtREAD MORE"
27,"It‚Äôs my first iPhone ever and I bought it with my earned money through part time jobs in college‚úåÔ∏èI am a tech freak so you can trust my views -- A14 Bionic is the fastest, most efficient and reliable processor till date- The camera focuses so quickly that you can take DSLR quality photos.- The screen size 6.1 inches is the most comfortable screen size out there and the OLED retina XDR display is so crisp and everything feels real.- The stereo speakers are so clear even on high volume an...READ MORE"
28,My first ios device. Oh boy this is a great device. I am so glad that I made the switch. The only thing I miss is the fast refresh rate of android but it‚Äôs not as bad as it sounds due to fluidity of iosCameras are excellent but not as sharp as newer android phones with bigger megapixels. But the quality and color accuracy of pictures are great.Battery life is also good. It would run a day and charges upto 90 percent in an hour.The display is gorgeous. One of the best.READ MORE
29,"Superb phone from apple. Buttery smooth and blazingly fast. Just missing telephoto camera at this price. This could be provided by Apple. Also charger is not coming along.

31,"I opened the iPhone 12 & found several strains of dust particles inside the box. This could only mean that the box was opened earlier & repacked to look like a fresh piece. May be this is why Flipkart is able to give discounts on iPhone like none others.FYI, manufacture period was May 2021 & I bought is in August 2021.READ MORE"
32,"If you are first time ios user u are surely going to miss few things frm android but the sense of security u get frm ios is unquestionable , and about the device its upto the mark the screen is so fluid that u will love it and battery optimisation is also top notch all the games i hv tried run buttery smooth so if u are ready to compromise on some features u can definitely go for itREAD MORE"

To Flipkart customer care 0 star, since they are dumb and will only reply copy paste message. To product, what to say it's an iPhone....

38,"Upgraded from Iphone X. If you are in Apple ecosystem, this is a good phone to upgrade. I'm glad I chose this phone 12 over 12 pro. The extra sensor and lens in pro is not worth the extra 35000 IMO. The delivery was perfect and right on time! Thanks Flipkart!READ MORE"

I bought 128GB variant and the difference from 64GB and 255GB is -10k and +10k which means apple is charging too much for 64GB storage, that means its not value for money exactly.. However buying a 64GB variant is a trap as you will need to keep on deleting data only.READ MORE"

141,The purple colour looks great. Its light weight and very sleek body. Display look awesome. Need to spend more money for charger after spending more than seventy thousand.Its bit annoying. Can't use old charger because of C type point.If apple really wants to stop global warming then it should make the cable usb type instead of C type. It just marketing strategy to sell charger separately there is no link to stop global warming.Really awful.READ MORE
